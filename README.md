# CyberEd - Educating about Cybersecurity

The CyberEd project is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)-based website aimed at teaching basic cybersecurity concepts at a high level. The original intended audience was a [GenCyber](https://www.gen-cyber.com/) summer camp hosted at the [South Dakota School of Mines and Technology](https://www.sdsmt.edu/), but it is also appropriate for use in classrooms or lab environments.

Each module of the CyberEd project is intended to teach a specific concept or topic and provide a number of examples and interactive demos to help students understand it's concepts. The modules included in the original project covered Hashing, Steganography, and Password Security.

For information about hosting CyberEd, see the [Deployment](https://github.com/Notgnoshi/cybersec-project/wiki/Development) page.
