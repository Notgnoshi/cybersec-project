<h3>Image Metadata</h3>

<p>
    Below, we have the original image and then the version with your message in it; can you tell that the data is there?
</p>

<div class="text-center container-fluid my-3">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <div class="card">
                <img src="{% url 'steganography:original_image' key_prefix='exif' %}"
                    class="card-img-top img-thumbnail rounded">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Original Image: {{original_total_size}} bytes</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <div class="card">
                <img src="{% url 'steganography:encoded_image' key_prefix='exif' operation=0 %}"
                    class="card-img-top img-thumbnail rounded">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Image With Hidden Message: {{encoded_total_size}} bytes</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    If we open the image with a tool that views it as raw data, we can see the difference between the two images. The
    data in the original
    image looks like this:
</p>
<div class="card my-3">
    <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
            <samp>{{original_start_bytes}}</samp></p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    But the data in the image with the hidden message looks like this; you can see the hidden message:
</p>
<div class="card my-3">
    <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">
            <samp>{{encoded_start_bytes}}</samp></p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    As you can see, using metadata tags is a great way to hide data in plain sight, because it doesn't change the image,
    but
    if someone looks closely at the file with a tool, they can easily find the message. Can you think of ways you might
    further hide the message?
    One simple solution would be to use an encryption to make the data more secure; but that also requires that whoever
    you send the message
    to knows the secret key to decrypt the information.
</p>
<p>
    In the next section, you're going to learn about a method called <b>image deltas</b>, where the image itself is the
    secret key that you use
    to decode the message.
