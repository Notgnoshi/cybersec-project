<h3>Image Deltas</h3>
<h4>Encoding Pictures</h4>
<p>Take a look at the two images below. Can you tell which one is the original image, and which one has the
    encoded data? Can you tell what the encoded data is?
</p>

<!--Result pictures-->

<p>It's very difficult to tell the difference. The message that was encoded is a picture where every pixel is either
    black or white. If the pixel is supposed to be black, then the delta for that pixel is 1 or -1. So some of the
    pixels in the
    encoded picture are different from the original, but they are only 1 more or 1 less.
</p>

<div class="card">
    <!--Picture with 2 different colors-->
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>This picture has two different colors in it, they have a difference in their values of 1; it's pretty hard to
            tell the difference!</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Lets decode the image. First, we take the original image, and subtract the modified image - This gives us the delta
    image, where every pixel
    value is either 1 or 0. If we leave it like this, it's very hard to see the hidden message. So the next step is to
    <b>normalize</b> the data. This means
    that we adjust it to take the biggest possible range of values. So we have values in the range [0, 1], and we expand
    them to the range [0, 255]. This makes it
    obvious what the hidden picture is.
</p>

<h4>Encoding Text</h4>
<p>
    A lot of hidden messages are not pictures, they are text; how might you adjust the image to hide text in it instead?
    We will start by
    assigning a number to every letter of the alphabet, from 1-26. Then we take our message, and we assign each letter
    to a pixel in the picture, in order.
    We will adjust that pixel by adding the value for the letter to that pixel. This means that every pixel in the
    adjusted image might be different by
    up to 26 values. Take a look at the example here; can you tell the difference between two colors that differ by 26.
