<h3>Example Hashes</h3>

<p>One of the most widely known hash algorithms is the MD5 sum; or Message Digest 5. It was
    developed in 1992 as a successor the MD4 algorithm. Although it is now considered
    unsecure, it is still used in a lot of applications because it is 'good enough' or
    because switching would require a large effort.
</p>
<p>Another well-known series of hash algorithms are the SHA series; SHA0, SHA1, SHA2, and
    SHA3 have all been developed as increasingly secure standards of hashing. As computers
    become faster, algorithms like the SHA series become less secure; at this point, SHA0
    and SHA1 are no longer acceptable, and SHA2 is close to becoming obselete.
