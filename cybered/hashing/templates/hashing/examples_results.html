        <h3>Example Hashes</h3>

        <p>In the table below, you can see some different message digests of the text you entered. Can
            you tell what the original text was just by looking at the digests? Go back to the previous
            page with the button below and try putting in some other text.
        </p>
        <p>Try something with just one letter different; then try some really long text and some really
            short text. Do the hash functions used follow the properties of a good hash function?
        </p>

        <p>When you're done experimenting with hash functions, click the next button to move on to...
            [insert next thing here]
