        <h3>An Example</h3>
        <p>
            Alice wants to send a long, complicated email to Bob. She does not care if other people see the message, but
            it is <i>very</i>
            important that Bob receives the message <i>exactly</i> the same as she sends it. Chuck does not like Bob,
            and he
            tries to intercept the message and change it so that Bob gets the wrong message! What are some ways that
            Alice and Bob
            might try to make sure Bob gets the correct message?
            <ul>
                <li>Alice could tell Bob the message in-person, but that would be hard because it is a long message.
                </li>
                <li>Alice could encrypt the message, and then tell Bob the secret key for the encryption, but that would
                    take a long time because it is a long message.</li>
                <li>Alice could generate a message digest for her message, and tell that to Bob in person. Bob can use
                    the digest to make sure he receives the correct message.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Message Digests</h3>
        <p>
            A <b>message digest</b> is a short piece of information that is used to characterize or describe a large
            piece of information. For example, Alice might use a <b>hash function</b> to generate the following
            digest to describe her long message:

            <pre>5578833a0c6cb26394a1414140718cab</pre>

            Instead of having to tell Bob the whole message in-person, she can just tell him that short piece of
            information. Then, when Bob gets Alice's message, he can use the same hash function to generate a message
            digest. If the message digest that Bob gets is the same as the one Alice gave him, then it is <i>very</i>
            likely that he received the correct message!
        </p>

        <h3>Hash Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Hash functions take a message and produce a message digest from it. There are many ways that a
            hash function can do this, but the most important feature of a hash function is that it is a one-way
            function, which means you can always get the same digest from a
            specific input, but you can never start with the digest and figure out the original input.
        </p>
        <p>
            A very simple hash function might convert every letter to a number, and then add them all up.
            Lets say that A=1, B=2, C=3...
            <ul>
                <li>cat = 3 + 1 + 20 = 24</li>
                <li>dog = 4 + 15 + 7 = 26</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because hash functions are used to condense data, it is possible for multiple messages
            to result in the same digest. This is called a <b>collision</b> and there's nothing wrong
            with it, as long as that is very difficult to do on purpose. If Chuck is able to make
            a new message with the same digest as Alice's, then he can send that to Bob, and Bob
            will think it is the real message!
        </p>
        <p>
            Is our hash function above a good hash function according to this rule?
            No, it's not! We can come up with many words that have the same digest. The easiest
            way is to re-arrange the letters of the message.
            <ul>
                <li>dog = 4 + 15 + 7 = 26</li>
                <li>god = 7 + 15 + 4 = 26</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p> Modern hash functions can be very complicated because they need to make digests with two
            specific properties:
            <ul>
                <li>It must be impossible to use the digest to figure out the original message</li>
                <li>It must be hard to make a different message that has the same digest</li>
            </ul>
            In order to get these properties, hash functions do things like always produce a hash
            that is the same size, regardless of the size of the message, or making a completely
            different digest for messages that are almost exactly the same.
