    <h1>Hashing</h1>
    <h2>Example Hashes</h2>

    <p>In the table below, you can see some different message digests of the text you entered. Can
        you tell what the original text was just by looking at the digests? Go back to the previous
        page with the button below and try putting in some other text.
    </p>
    <p>Try somthing with just one letter different; then try some really long text and some really
        short text. Do the hash functions exhibited follow the properties of a good hash function?
    </p>
    <p>When you're done experimenting with hash functions, click the next button to move on to...

    </p>

    <h3>Computed Message Digests</h3>
    <p>The following table lists the computed message digests for the text you entered:</p>
    <pre>{{ input_text }}</pre>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Hash Algorithm</th>
            <th>Message Digest</th>
