            <h2>Example Hashes</h2>
            <p>In the table below, you can see some different message digests of the text you entered. Can you tell what
                the original text was
                just by looking at the digests? Go back to the previous page with the button below and try putting in
                some other text.
                Try somthing with just one letter different; then try some really long text and some really short text.
                Do the hash functions
                exhibited follow the properties of a good hash function listed previously?
            </p>

                When you're done experimenting with hash functions, click the next button to move on to... [insert next
