<h3>Keyed Hashes</h3>

<p>
    Below, you can see how we combined the text you entered with the password you entered.
    We calculated the message digest for the text both with and without the password;
    as you can see, adding the key changes the digest a lot.
</p>

<h4>Computed Message Digests</h4>
<p>The following table lists the computed message digests for the text you entered:</p>

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Original Text</h5>
        <div style="max-height: 100px; overflow-y: auto;">
            {{ input_text }}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Password</h5>
        <div style="max-height: 100px; overflow-y: auto;">
            {{ input_key }}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">

    <h3>HMAC</h3>
    <p>
        In our example, we combined the password with the text by just adding it to the
        beginning and end
        of the message. In order for keyed hashes to work, both the sender and receiver have
        to agree on
        how to add the key to the message; most secure communication that relies on message
        digests today uses
        a standard protocol called HMAC.

    <h4>Lesson Recap</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A <b>keyed hash</b> can be used to guarantee your message was sent by the correct person.
        <ul>
            <li>Using a keyed hash makes it next to impossible to generate the correct hash if you don't know the
                password
            </li>
            <li>It's simple to add a password to your hash like this</li>
            <li>The standard method of creating a keyed hash is called HMAC</li>
        </ul>
